                <h1>The History of Richie's Golden Mile</h1>
                <p>The Golden Mile is a stretch of water between Baltimore and Sherkin Island in West Cork. It was here
                    in Baltimore, while
                    learning how to sail, that Richie was challenged to a bet. He was 15 or 16 at the time and the bet
                    was for Â£20.
                    The bet was that he couldn't swim the Golden Mile, i.e. from the harbour in Baltimore to the harbour
                    in Sherkin Island.
                    <br>
                    As he took on the bet everyone thought that he would only make it half way, but when the skeptics,
                    who followed
                    alongside in a boat, realised he was going all the way, they jumped in and swam the rest with him.
                    <br>
                    So, on the anniversary of Richie's passing on the 30th of June each year (weather permitting) we
                    swim the Golden Mile... Richie's Golden Mile. By doing this we hope to not only remember and honour
                    Richie, but
                    also raise money
                    for his chosen charity; The Cystic Fibrosis Ward in Temple Street Children's Hospital. Inspired by a
                    little girl, Robyn,
                    Richie knew that this was the charity he wanted to collect for.
                    <br>
                    If you feel fit enough and are up for a challenge, we would love as many people as possible, who
                    knew Richie or not, to
                    come along each year and raise some much needed funds for the children in Temple Street.
                    It's not important how you do Richie's Golden Mile or how fast you get across, only to take part and remember him for the
                    extraordinary person that
                    he was, and of course, to help us raise money in his name for Temple Street.
