                <br>
                <p>RGM is an annual open-water swim from Sherkin Island to Baltimore harbour.
                    Covering a distance of one nautical mile, it is the perfect swim-meet for your calander whether
                    you're
                    just beginning your openwater adventure or are a seasoned
                    triathlete looking to rack up your practice.</p>

                <h3>Location</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Situated on the Teddy Bears toes of Ireland in Baltimore, West Cork, you'll find this is one of the
                    most beautiful and
                    idyllic settings for a swim along the Wild Atlantic Way.
                    Hosted late into the balmy month of June against
                    the backdrop of this cosy fishing village, the swim itself - and of course the apr√©s-swim - are
                    simply
                    not to be missed. Truly an experience that lives long in the memory!</p>

                <h3>Safety & Fundraising</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Saftey is paramount at RGM and your Registration includes full event insurance and a chaperone from
                    Baltimore's RNLI. Local volunteers will also kayak alongside swimmers in teams, ensuring evey
                    swimmer is monitored and cared for. If anyone is in any difficulty, we'll get you out of the water
                    quickly! Always remember to FLOAT! should you find yourself starting to tire!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Your welcome pack will include your personal sponsership link - we encourage and hope all
                    participants
                    will fundraise as much as they can. All fundraising from Richie's Golden Mile is donated to
                    Temple Street Childrens Hospital - so please
                    support this worthy cause as much as you can!</p>
